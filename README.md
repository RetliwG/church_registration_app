## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Google Sheets

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create a new spreadsheet
3. Rename it to "Church Youth Registration"
4. Create three sheets (tabs) with these exact names:
   - `Parents`
   - `Children`
   - `SignInOut`

### 2. Set up Google OAuth & Sheets API

**üîê Secure Setup with Private Spreadsheet**

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Sheets API:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click on it and press "Enable"
4. **Set up OAuth 2.0 (for user authentication)**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Choose "Web application"
   - Add authorized JavaScript origins:
     - `https://retliwg.github.io`
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     - `https://retliwg.github.io/church_registration_app/`
   - Click "Create" and copy the Client ID
5. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" (unless you have a Google Workspace)
   - Fill in app name: "Church Youth Registration"
   - Add your email as developer contact

   - No need to make it public!

### 3. Configure the PWA

**üîí Secure OAuth Configuration**

1. **Deploy your app first** (step 4 below)
2. **Visit the configuration page**: `https://retliwg.github.io/church_registration_app/config-setup.html`
3. **Enter your OAuth Client ID and Spreadsheet ID**
4. **Test the authentication** - you'll be prompted to login with Google
5. **Authorize the app** to access your private Google Sheets

**Why this is secure:**
- ‚úÖ **Private spreadsheet** - only authorized users can access
- ‚úÖ **OAuth authentication** - users login with their Google accounts
- ‚úÖ **No API keys in code** - uses secure OAuth flow
- ‚úÖ **Granular permissions** - only access to specified spreadsheet

## Browser Support

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge

## Troubleshooting

### "Error initializing application"
- Check that your API key is correct in `config.js`
- Verify that the Google Sheets API is enabled
- Ensure your spreadsheet is publicly accessible
- **Check API key restrictions**: Make sure your website URL is allowed in the API key restrictions

### "Error saving/loading data"
- Confirm your spreadsheet ID is correct
- Check that the sheet names match exactly: "Parents", "Children", "SignInOut"
- Verify your internet connection

### App not loading on iPad
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (GitHub Pages automatically provides this)
- Clear your browser cache and reload
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that your Google Sheets configuration is correct

### GitHub Pages not updating
- Changes can take a few minutes to appear
- Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository for deployment status
- Make sure you pushed your latest changes to the main branch

## Security Notes

- **Data Privacy Options**: 
  - **Public Spreadsheet**: Anyone with the link can view your data (but cannot edit without API key)
  - **Private Spreadsheet**: Requires a backend server - more complex but completely private
- **Client-Side Limitations**: This app runs in the browser, so some credentials are visible to users
- **API Key Security**: Restricted to your specific website and Google Sheets API only
- **Recommendation**: Start with public spreadsheet approach, migrate to backend solution if privacy is critical
- **HTTPS Required**: GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS, which is required for secure API calls

### Privacy Considerations

If your church registration data is sensitive, consider:
1. Using a dedicated spreadsheet just for this app (no existing sensitive data)
2. Implementing the backend server approach for complete privacy
3. Using the app only on trusted devices/networks
4. Regularly reviewing who has access to the spreadsheet

## Customization

You can easily customize the application by:
- Modifying the CSS in `styles.css` for different colors/fonts
- Adding new fields to the registration forms
- Changing the validation rules in `app.js`
- Adding new features like reporting or data export

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Google Sheets setup
3. Ensure all files are uploaded correctly
4. Test with a simple registration first
