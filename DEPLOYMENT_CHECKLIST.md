- Access tokens are generated dynamically and expire automatically
- Permissions are scoped only to your specific Google Spreadsheet

### Data Management
- All data is stored in your private Google Spreadsheet
- You maintain full control and ownership of the data
- Export to Excel/CSV available through Google Sheets
- Automatic revision history and backup through Google
- Multiple admin access possible through Google Sheets sharing
